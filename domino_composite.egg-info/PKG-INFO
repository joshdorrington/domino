# Domino is a package for analysing composites of atmospheric data.
## Based on xarray, Domino makes it easy to calculate lagged composites of fields and scalar indices around categorical event time series, and to compute bootstrapped confidence bounds. This is still an alpha release! While core functionality is stable, there could be some bugs!

## Documentation

See our API reference here: https://github.com/joshdorrington/domino/blob/master/docbuild/domino-composite.pdf

## Examples

See our Jupyter notebook examples for more detailed discussion of how to apply Domino to different use cases.

Our [basic](https://github.com/joshdorrington/domino/blob/master/examples/basic_compositing.ipynb) and [advanced](https://github.com/joshdorrington/domino/blob/master/examples/advanced_compositing.ipynb) compositing guides cover the use of Domino's flexible LaggedAnalyser class to easily compute time-lagged composites and apply bootstrap significance tests to them.

Producing filtered precursor patterns from composites, and computing precursor activity indices from those is covered in our [IndexGenerator](https://github.com/joshdorrington/domino/blob/master/examples/precursor_index_computation.ipynb) guide.


## Install

domino can be installed using pip:
```
python -m pip install "domino-composite==0.272"
```
If you want to run the worked examples in the Jupyter notebooks you will need:
